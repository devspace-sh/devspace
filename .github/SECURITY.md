# Security Policy
We will disclose fixes for vulnerabilities in the release notes and urge you to upgrade once a new release is published. DevSpace versions the configuration in `devspace.yaml` and allows you to use any older configuration with a newer CLI version.

**To receive update warnings in the CLI (as part of the terminal output whenever you run a command), you must use an official release binary as published on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace/releases) of this project.**

See the [install instructions for DevSpace](https://devspace.sh/cli/docs/getting-started/installation) for the recommended methods of downloading an official release binary for your platform. Community maintained release binaries (e.g. `brew` formular for DevSpace) may **not** contain the version number and will therefore not be able to perform a version check.
