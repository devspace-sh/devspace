The easiest way to connect a domain to your deployment is to run the following command within your project directory:
```bash
devspace open
```
Choose **via domain** to connect a domain or choose **via localhost** to use port-forwarding.

## Component Chart
If you are looking for the documentation of the component chart values that let you configure the ingress and service for a component in `devspace.yaml`, please look into the **[Component Chart Documentation](https://devspace.sh/component-chart/docs/introduction)**.

## Troubleshooting
Here are some steps to debug issues with your application when your domain is not able to reach your application.

### Listen On All Interfaces
Make sure your application is running on `0.0.0.0` and not on `localhost`. If you see a log message in your container logs such as `Listening on localhost:PORT` or  `Listening on 127.0.0.1:PORT`, you need to change the configuration of your application, so that it starts listening on `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`.

:::info Only Localhost Works
This is often the problem when you are able to use `devspace open` with `via localhost` but not with the `via domain` option.

### Check For Failing Containers
Make sure none of your containers is constantly restarting (`Restarts` > 0) or unable to starting (`Status` != Running):
```bash
kubectl get po
```

### Check Services and Endpoints
Make sure you have at least one service for your main application configured:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```

And make sure all your services have at least one endpoint:
```bash
kubectl get ep
```
