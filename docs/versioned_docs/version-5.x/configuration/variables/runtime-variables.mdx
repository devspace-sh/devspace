Runtime variables are special variables that are only available in certain config areas and are filled during runtime. Those variables are useful to access certain runtime information, such as hook output or image tags.

<Tabs
defaultValue="var1"
values={[
    { label: 'Separate Repo & Tag', value: 'var1', },
    { label: 'Customize Helm Values', value: 'var2', },
    { label: 'Dependency', value: 'var3', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="var1">

```yaml
images:
  app:
    image: registry.url/repo/image
deployments:
- name: backend
  helm:
    chart:
      name: chart-name
      repo: https://my-charts.company.tld/
    values:
      # Will be rewritten to registry.url/repo/image:generated_tag
      imageWithTag: ${runtime.images.app}
      # Will be rewritten to registry.url/repo/image
      imageWithoutTag: ${runtime.images.app.image}
      # Will be rewritten to generated_tag
      onlyTag: ${runtime.images.app.tag}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="var2">

```yaml
images:
  app:
    image: myuser/image
hooks:
  - name: "image-digest"
    command: |
      # This command prints the image digest
      echo $(docker inspect ${runtime.images.app.image}:${runtime.images.app.tag} --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' | cut -d'@' -f2)
    events: ["after:build:app"]
deployments:
- name: checkout
  helm:
    chart:
      name: ./kubernetes/helm/app
    values:
      app:
        image:
          digest: ${runtime.hooks.image-digest.stdout}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="var3">

```yaml
dependencies:
- name: dep1
  source:
    path: dep1
dev:
  # Will open a terminal to the pod with the 
  # image from dep1
  terminal:
    imageSelector: ${runtime.dependencies.dep1.images.image1}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
    
Runtime variables can be used in the following DevSpace config sections:

```
/images/*/build/custom/command
/images/*/build/custom/commands/*/command
/images/*/build/custom/args/*
/images/*/build/custom/appendArgs/*
/deployments/*/helm/values/**
/deployments/*/tanka/**
/hooks/*/command
/hooks/*/args/*
/hooks/*/container/imageSelector
/dev/ports/*/imageSelector
/dev/sync/*/imageSelector
/dev/replacePods/*/imageSelector
/dev/replacePods/*/replaceImage
/dev/logs/*/selectors/*/imageSelector
/dev/terminal/imageSelector
```

:::info
If you try to use a runtime variable in a different config section, DevSpace will print an error and fail.
:::

The following runtime variables exist:

- **`runtime.images.IMAGE_NAME`**: Holds the image name (defined at `images.*.image`) and tag that was built by DevSpace (e.g. `my-repo.com/image:latest`)
- **`runtime.images.IMAGE_NAME.tag`**: Holds the image tag that was built by DevSpace (e.g. `asdHTR` or `latest`)
- **`runtime.images.IMAGE_NAME.image`**: Holds the image name (defined at `images.*.image`) that was used for building (e.g. `my-repo.com/image`)
- **`runtime.hooks.HOOK_NAME.stdout`**: Holds the stdout output of an executed local or remote hook command
- **`runtime.hooks.HOOK_NAME.stderr`**: Holds the stderr output of an executed local or remote hook command 

## Accessing runtime variables of dependencies

You can also access runtime variables of an executed dependency by using `runtime.dependencies.DEPENDENCY_NAME...`. 

For example:
```yaml
dependencies:
- name: dep1
  source:
    path: dep1
dev:
  # Will open a terminal to the pod with the 
  # image from dep1
  terminal:
    imageSelector: ${runtime.dependencies.dep1.images.image1}
```
