DevSpace is designed to work in non-interactive environments the same way it does in interactive environments. To use DevSpace inside a CI/CD pipeline, simply install it as part of your pipeline or start the pipeline with a VM or container image that already contains DevSpace and run any of the DevSpace commands.

## Deployment Tips

### Avoid Pickers
If you want to run commands such as `devspace enter`, make sure you specify a label selector using `-l`, a container using `-c` etc. to make sure DevSpace can find the right pod/container without having to ask you to select one (which would lead to your pipeline getting stuck).

### `--wait` Flag
DevSpace is configured to deploy and terminate when you run `devspace deploy`. In CI/CD pipelines, it is common to wait until the deployment is actually up and running before continuing the pipeline. You can achieve this by using `--wait`:
```bash
devspace --wait --timeout=120
```
The above command will wait until the desired number of pods is created for all ReplicaSets and until none of the pods are failing anymore. If this is not achieved within the number of seconds specified in `--timeout`, DevSpace will exit with a fatal error.

## DevSpace Cloud

### Authentication
If you want to use DevSpace Cloud in your CI/CD pipeline as well, you need to generate an ["Access Key"](https://app.devspace.cloud/settings/access-keys) and use it to login to DevSpace Cloud using the following non-interactive command:
```bash
devspace login --key=[YOUR_ACCESS_KEY]
```

### Encryption Keys / Using Spaces
If you are using the SaaS edition of DevSpace Cloud, you need to provide an encryption key to create or use a space in a connected cluster. You can do this by passing the encryption key to stdin like this:
```bash
echo $DEVSPACE_CLOUD_ENCRYPTION_KEY >> devspace use space production
```
