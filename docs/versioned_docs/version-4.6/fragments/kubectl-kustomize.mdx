The `kustomize` option expects a boolean stating if DevSpace should deploy using `kustomize` (or alternatively: `kubectl apply -k`).

:::warning
If you set `kustomize = true`, all of your `manifests` must be paths to Kustomizations. If you want to deploy some plain manifests and some Kustomizations, create multiple deployments for each of them.
:::

#### Default Value for `kustomize`
```yaml
kustomize: false
```

#### Example: Kustomize
```yaml {4}
deployments:
- name: backend
  kubectl:
    kustomize: true
    manifests:
    - kustomization1/
    - glob/path/to/more/kustomizations/
```
