The function `run_watch` takes in a path to watch and a subcommand to run on that path.

## Arguments

### `--fail-on-error`

If true, the command will fail on an error while running the subcommand.

```
run_watch --path [MY_PATH] -- [my_command]
```

### `--path`, `-p`

The paths to watch. Can be patterns in the form of `"./**/my-file.txt"`.

Please note that globgs need to be quoted in order to avoid them being expanded
by your shell, for example:


```
run_watch --path "**/*.go" -- devspace dev
```


```
```

### Example

```yaml
commands:
  # Overwrites dev
  dev: |-
    run_watch -p devspace.yaml -p *.go -- devspace run-pipeline dev $@
```
