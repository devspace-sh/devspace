The `kustomize` option expects a boolean stating if DevSpace should deploy using `kustomize` (or alternatively: `kubectl apply -k` when `kustomize` is not installed).

:::warning
If you set `kustomize: true`, all of your `manifests` must be paths to Kustomizations. If you want to deploy some plain manifests and some Kustomizations, create multiple deployments for each of them.
:::

#### Default Value for `kustomize`
```yaml
kustomize: false
```

#### Example: Kustomize
```yaml {4}
deployments:
  backend:
    kubectl:
      kustomize: true
      manifests:
      - kustomization1/
      - glob/path/to/more/kustomizations/
```
