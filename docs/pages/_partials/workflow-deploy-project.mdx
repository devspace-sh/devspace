DevSpace iterates over every item in the `deployments` array defined in the `devspace.yaml` and deploys each of the deployments using the respective deployment tool:
- `kubectl` deployments will be deployed with `kubectl` (optionally using `kustomize` if `kustomize: true`)
- `helm` deployments will be deployed with the `helm` client that comes in-built with DevSpace

:::info kubectl Required
Deployments with `kubectl` require `kubectl` to be installed.
