The `kustomizeBinaryPath` option expects a path to the `kustomize` binary. By default, DevSpace will use the `kustomize` located on your `$PATH`. Use this to specify a location for `kustomize` if it is not on your `$PATH`.

:::warning
Setting `kustomizeBinaryPath` makes it much harder to share your `devspace.yaml` with other team mates. It is recommended to add `kustomize` to your `$PATH` environment variable instead.

#### Example: Setting Path To Kustomize Binary
```yaml
deployments:
  backend:
    kubectl:
      kustomize: true
      kustomizeBinaryPath: /path/to/kustomize
      manifests:
      - backend/
```
**Explanation:**  
Deploying the above example would use the `/path/to/kustomize` binary to render the manifests before using `kubectl` to apply them.
