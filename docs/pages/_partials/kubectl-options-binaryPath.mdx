The `kubectlBinaryPath` is optional expects a path to the `kubectl` binary. By default, DevSpace will use the `kustomize` located on your `$PATH`.  Use this to specify a location for `kubectl` if it is not on your `$PATH` and you do not want DevSpace to download the latest version.

:::warning
Setting `kubectlBinaryPath` makes it much harder to share your `devspace.yaml` with other team mates. It is recommended to add `kubectl` to your `$PATH` environment variable instead.

#### Example: Setting Path To Kubectl Binary
```yaml
deployments:
  backend:
    kubectl:
      kubectlBinaryPath: /path/to/kubectl
      manifests:
      - backend/
```
**Explanation:**  
Deploying the above example would roughly be equivalent to this command:
```bash
/path/to/kubectl apply -f backend/
```
