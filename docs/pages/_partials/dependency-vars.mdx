The `vars` option expects an array of objects with name and value of variables defined in the `devspace.yaml` of this dependency. When configuring this option, the variables will be overriden similar to passing variables via the `--var` flag to devspace.
It is also useful to deploy the same dependency multiple times with just small adjustments.

#### Example: Override Config Vars for Dependency
```yaml
# This will deploy the api server two times with
# different variable configurations
dependencies:
- source:
    git: https://github.com/my-api-server
  vars:
  - name: NAME
    value: api-server-1
- source:
    git: https://github.com/my-api-server
  vars:
  - name: NAME
    value: api-server-2
```
