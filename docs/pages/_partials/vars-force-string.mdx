:::note Variable Type
By default, the type (string, int, bool) of variable will be determined by the type of its `default` value (if defined) or automatically detected if no default value is defined. To explicitly use the value of a variable as a string, use `$!{VAR_NAME}` instead of `${VAR_NAME}`.
