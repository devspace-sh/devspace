DevSpace loads the `dependencies` section from the `devspace.yaml` and creates a dependency tree. The current project will represent the root of this tree. Based on this dependency tree, DevSpace will start from the leaves and run these steps for each dependency:
- Build images of the dependency as configured in the `images` section of the dependency's `devspace.yaml` (unless `skipBuild: true`)
- Deploy the dependency as configured in the `deployments` section of the dependency's `devspace.yaml`

:::note What are Dendencies?
Dependencies allow you to deploy microservices, that the project you are currently deploying relies on. Dependencies can be located in a subpath of your project or they can be automatically loaded from a different git repository.
