import FragmentVarsName from '../../_partials/vars-name.mdx';
import FragmentVarsDefault from '../../_partials/vars-default.mdx';
import FragmentVarsForceString from '../../_partials/vars-force-string.mdx';

If the `source` is `command`, DevSpace will **<u>not</u>** ask the user a question and instead execute a command to determine the value of the variable.
```yaml {3,5-8}
images:
  database:
    image: "mysql:${MYSQL_VERSION}"
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  # Will execute the command in a Golang Shell (cross plattform compatible)
  command: "echo 5.5"
```

If you need different commands depending on the operating system you can use `commands`:
```yaml {3,7-10}
images:
  database:
    image: "mysql:${MYSQL_VERSION}"
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  commands:
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.5'"]
    os: linux,darwin
  command: echo
  args: ["5.5"]
```

:::info
If not command for the current operating system can be found under `commands`, the `command` and `args` will be used as fallback.
:::

<FragmentVarsForceString/>

## Configuration

### `name`

<FragmentVarsName/>


### `command` & `args`

The command and arguments to execute to retrieve the value of the variable. The captured stdout of the command will be used as variable value. Whitespaces and newlines will be trimmed from the command output.

:::tip
You can use other variables in the command or args definition as long as they are either a predefined variable or defined before the variable in the `vars` array. For example:
```yaml
vars:
- name: SECRET_NAME
  source: env
- name: SECRET_VALUE
  command: ./retrieve-secret-value.sh
  args: ["--secret-name=${SECRET_NAME}", "--namespace=${devspace.namespace}"]
```
:::

### `commands`

Commands expects an array of objects that define commands for specific operating systems. If no command can be found for the current operating system in `commands`, then `command` will be used as fallback.

```yaml
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  commands:
  # Use command on linux
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.5'"]
    os: linux
  # Use command on mac
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.6'"]
    os: darwin
  # Use on all other operating systems
  command: echo
  args: ["5.5"]
```

### `default`

If the command returns nothing, this is the value that will be used for this variable.

### `alwaysResolve`

If enabled, the variable will be loaded even though it is not used within the config. This might be useful for variables that should be resolved after a config expression is applied. E.g.:

`devspace.yaml`:
```
vars:
- name: my-var
  value: my-value
  alwaysResolve: true
hooks:
- name: my-hook
  command: $(cat command.txt)
  events: ["after:deploy"]
```

`command.txt`:
```
echo Hello ${my-var}!
```
