title: Build Images with kaniko
sidebar_label: kaniko
---

Using [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) as build tool allows you to build images directly inside your Kubernetes cluster without a Docker daemon. DevSpace simply starts a build pod and builds the image using `kaniko`.

:::note Automatic Cleanup
After the build process completes, the build pod started for the kaniko build process will be deleted again.
:::

To set `kaniko` as default build tool, use the following configuration:
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko: {}
```

## Flags & Arguments

### `cache`
The `cache` option expects a boolean that states if kaniko should make use of layer caching by pulling the previously build image and using the layers of this image as cache.

#### Default Value For `cache`
```yaml
cache: true
```

#### Example: Building Images with kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
  frontend:
    image: john/appfrontend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: false
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` would be built using kaniko and make use of the build cache.
- The second image `frontend` would be built using kaniko and **not** use the build cache.


### `snapshotMode`
The `snapshotMode` option expects a string that can have the following values:
- `full` tells kaniko to do a full filesystem snapshot
- `time` tells kaniko to do a filesystem snapshot based on `mtime` (default)

:::warning Limitations
One of the biggest limitations of the `time` mode is that kaniko might **miss** file metadata changes introduced by `RUN` statements, e.g. kaniko might skip a command such as `RUN chown 333:333 -R /app`. In cases where this is not an option, use `full` instead. Learn more about [limitations related to kaniko snapshots using `mtime`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#mtime-and-snapshotting).
:::

#### Default Value For `snapshotMode`
```yaml
snapshotMode: time
```

#### Example: Building Images with kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
  frontend:
    image: john/appfrontend
    build:
      kaniko:
        snapshotMode: time
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` would be built using kaniko and creating full filesystem snapshots.
- The second image `frontend` would be built using kaniko and calculate filesystem snapthots only based on `mtime`.


### `insecure`
The `insecure` option expects a boolean stating if kaniko should allow to push to an insecure (plain HTTP instead of HTTPS) registry.

:::warning
This option should only be set to `true` for testing purposes.
:::

#### Default Value For `insecure`
```yaml
insecure: false
```

#### Example: Push to Insecure Registry With kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: 123.456.789.0:5000/john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        insecure: false
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and pushing to the insecure registry `123.456.789.0:5000` would be allowed.


### `args`
The `args` option expects an array of strings that will be passed as arguments (and flags) when running the kaniko build command.

:::note Kaniko Documentation
Take a look at the kaniko documentation for a full [list of available flags](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#additional-flags).
:::

#### Default Value For `args`
```yaml
args: []
```

#### Example: Passing Args to kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        args:
        - --cache-dir=/tmp
        - --verbosity=debug
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and the flags `--cache-dir=/tmp --verbosity=debug` would be set when running the build command within the kaniko pod used for image building.

## Build Pod Configuration

### `image`
The `image` option expects a string stating the image that should be used for the kaniko container within the build pod.

#### Default Value For `image`
```yaml
image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.17.1
```

#### Example: Use Different Kaniko Image/Version
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: 123.456.789.0:5000/john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.19.0
```

### `initImage`
The `initImage` option expects a string stating the image that should be used for the init kaniko container within the build pod. (default is `alpine`)

### `pullSecret`
The `pullSecret` option expects a string with the name of a Kubernetes secret which is used by kaniko as pull/push secret (e.g. for pulling the base image defined in the `FROM` statement of the Dockerfile and for pushing the newly built image after the kaniko build process).

:::info
In most cases, DevSpace already makes sure that kaniko gets the correct pull secrets to push and pull to registries.
:::

#### Default Value For `pullSecret`
```yaml
pullSecret: ""
```

#### Example: Pull Secret For kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        pullSecret: custom-pull-secret
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and kaniko would use the Kubernete secret `custom-pull-secret` to pull images from registries that require authentication.

:::tip Creating Pull Secrets using `hooks`
If you use the `pullSecret` option, you have to manually create the secret before DevSpace tries to build your images. You can automate this by [defining a hook in devspace.yaml](../../configuration/hooks/basics.mdx) as show in this example:
```yaml
hooks:
- command: kubectl
  args:
    - create
    - secret
    - generic
    - custom-pull-secret
    - --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
    - --from-literal
    - .dockerconfigjson='{ "credsStore":"ecr-login" }'
  when:
    before:
      images: all
```
:::

:::note Building AWS ECR images on EKS
If your EKS instance is [configured with access to ECR (see instance role permissions for AWS EKS and ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_EKS.html), your pull secret referenced by the `pullSecret` option, could be created with this kubectl command:
```yaml
kubectl create secret generic custom-pull-secret --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson --from-literal .dockerconfigjson='{ "credsStore":"ecr-login" }'
```
The resulting Kubernetes secret would look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
metadata:
  name: custom-pull-secret
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: eyAiY3JlZHNTdG9yZSI6ImVjci1sb2dpbiIgfQ==
```
If you define `pullSecret: custom-pull-secret` as shown in the example above, DevSpace will automatically mount this secret into the kaniko container and kaniko will be able to pull from and push to ECR.
:::


### `additionalMounts`
The `additionalMounts` option expects an array of mount options that allow to mount Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps into the kaniko container within the build pod.

#### Default Value For `additionalMounts`
```yaml
additionalMounts: []
```

#### Example: Mount ConfigMaps & Secrets For Kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        additionalMounts:
        - mountPath: /some/configmap/dir
          configMap:
            name: my-configmap
        - mountPath: /some/secret/dir
          secret:
            name: my-secret
            items:
            - key: aws-token
              path: token.json
```
**Explanation:**  
The above configuration would create a kaniko container which mounts the following volumes:
- All keys within the ConfigMap `my-configmap` will be mounted as files within the folder `/some/configmap/dir`. The filenames will be the keys within the ConfigMap.
- The key `aws-token` within the Secret `my-secret` will be mounted as the file `/some/secret/dir/token.json`.


### `resources`
The `resources` option expects a Kubernetes resource object, so that the kaniko pod can specify `requests` and `limits` for resources such as `memory` and `cpu`.

#### Default Value For `resources`
```yaml
resources: {}
```

#### Example: Resource Limits For Kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```


### `namespace`
The `namespace` option expects a string stating a namespace that should be used to start the kaniko build pod in.

:::warning Hard-Coding Namespaces Discouraged
Unless you really know what you are doing, it is discouraged to hard-code namespaces within devspace.yaml because that makes it harder to share the project and its configuration with others.
:::

#### Default Value For `namespace`
```yaml
namespace: "" # defaults to the default namespace of the current kube-context
```

#### Example: Different Namespace For kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        namespace: build-namespace
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and the build pod started to run the kaniko build process would be created within the namespace `build-namespace` within the cluster that the current kube-context points to.

### `serviceAccount`

The service account to use for the build pod.

### `nodeSelector`

A key value map of the node selector to use for the build pod.

### `tolerations`

Array of node [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#concepts) that should be used to schedule the build pod.

<br />

## Build Options
DevSpace allows you to configure the following build options:
- `target` defining the build target for multi-stage builds
- `network` to define which network to use during building (e.g. `docker build --network=host`)
- `buildArgs` to pass arguments to the Dockerfile during the build process


### `options.target`

The `target` option expects a string stating the build target when using multi-stage builds.

#### Example: Defining a Build Target for Docker
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        options:
          target: production
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using `docker` and the target `production` would be used for building the image as defined in the `Dockerfile`.


### `options.network`

The `network` option expects a string stating the network setting for building the image.

#### Example: Defining a Network for Docker
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        options:
          network: host
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using `docker` and `docker build` would be called using the `--network=host` flag.



### `options.buildArgs`

The `buildArgs` option expects a map of buildArgs representing values for the `--build-arg` flag used for `docker` or `kaniko` build commands.

#### Example: Defining Build Args for Docker
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        options:
          buildArgs:
            arg1: arg-value-2
            arg2: arg-value-2
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using `docker` and `docker build` would be called using the `--build-arg arg1=arg-value-1 --build-arg arg2=arg-value-2` flags.
