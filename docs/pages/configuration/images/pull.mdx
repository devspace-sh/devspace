If you want to deploy containers that run based on images from a private registry, your Kubernetes cluster needs credentials for the registry in order to pull these images. 


## Create Pull Secrets
In many cases, DevSpace automatically creates pull secrets for you but you can also manually create them.

### Automatic
DevSpace can automatically create pull secrets to provide registry credentials for Kubernetes to pull images from these private registries. DevSpace retrieves the credentials from your local credentials store in Docker.

The following functions can be called in the scripts defined in your `pipelines` section and when DevSpace executes them, it triggers pull secrets to be created:
1. `build_images` (unless [`createPullSecret`](../images#images-createPullSecret) is `false` for the respective image)
2. `ensure_pull_secrets`

### Manual
Instead of letting DevSpace automatically create pull secrets, you can also manually create them by using the [`pullSecrets` section in `devspace.yaml`](../pullSecrets/README.mdx)
