## `dockerfile`
The `dockerfile` option expects a string with a path to a `Dockerfile`.
- The path in `dockerfile` should be relative to the `devspace.yaml`.
- When setting the `dockerfile` option, it is often useful to set the [`context` option](#context) as well.
- To share your configuration with team mates, make sure `devspace.yaml` and all `Dockerfiles` used in the `images` section are checked into your code repository.

#### Default Value For `dockerfile`
```yaml
dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
```

#### Example: Different Dockerfile
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  frontend:
    image: john/appfrontend
    dockerfile: frontend/Dockerfile
    context: frontend/
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image would be built using the Dockerfile in `./Dockerfile` and the context path `./`.
- The second image would be built using the Dockerfile in `./frontend/Dockerfile` and the context path `./frontend/`.
- Switching the `context` for image `frontend` would assure that a statement like `ADD file.txt` or  `COPY file.txt .` in `./frontend/Dockerfile` would use the local file `./frontend/file.txt` instead of `./file.txt`.
- In this example, it would probably be useful to have a `./.dockerignore` file which ignores the `frontend/` folder when building the first image called `backend`.

:::note
See **[Best Practices for Image Building](../../guides/image-building.mdx)** for details on how to optimize your Dockerfiles and use `.dockerignore` for faster image building.
