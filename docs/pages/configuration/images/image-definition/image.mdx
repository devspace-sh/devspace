title: Image Name

The `images` section in `devspace.yaml` is a map with keys representing the name of the image and values representing the image definition including `tag`, `dockerfile` etc.
```yaml
images:                             # map[string]struct | Images to be built and pushed
  image1:                           # string   | Name of the image
    image: gcr.io/username/image    # string   | Image repository and name
    tags:                           # string[] | Image tags (may be a tagging schema with variables)
    - latest
    - 0.0.1
    - dev-${devspace.git.commit}
    - dev-${USER}-###               # Each # will be replaced with a random character
```

## `image` *Image Repository*
The `image` option expects a string containing the image repository including registry and image name.

- Make sure you [authenticate with the image registry](../../images/basics.mdx#authentication-registry) before using in here.
- For Docker Hub images, do not specify a registry hostname and use just the image name instead (e.g. `mysql`, `my-docker-username/image`).

#### Example: Multiple Images
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  frontend:
    image: custom-registry.com:5000/peter/appfrontend
```
**Explanation:**
- The first image `backend` would be tagged as `appbackend:[TAG]` pushed to Docker Hub using the path `john` (which generally could be your Docker Hub username).
- The second image `frontend` would be tagged as `appfrontend:[TAG]` and pushed to `custom-registry.com:5000` using the path `peter`.
