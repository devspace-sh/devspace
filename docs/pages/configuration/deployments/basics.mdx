:::info Sequential and Concurrent Deployment
Deployments, like images, will be processed in parallel by default. To process deployments sequentially, you can specify it as a dependency, or override the pipeline and call [create_deployments](../../configuration/pipelines/functions/create_deployments.mdx) sequentially.
:::

## Run Deployments
When you run one of the following commands, DevSpace will run the deployment process:
- `devspace deploy` (before deploying the application)
- `devspace dev` (before deploying the application and starting the development mode)

### Important Flags
The following flags are available for all commands that trigger the deployment process:
- `-d / --force-deploy` redeploy all deployments (even if they could be skipped because they have not changed)
- `-b / --force-build` rebuild all images (even if they could be skipped because context and Dockerfile have not changed)


## Deployment Process
DevSpace loads the `deployments` configuration from `devspace.yaml` and by default deploys each deployment sequentially in the order that they are specified in the `deployments` array. Alternatively, some or all deployments can be configured to deploy in parallel by setting `concurrent: true`. Deployments with concurrency enabled will deploy before sequential deployments. Additionally, DevSpace also deploys related projects specified in `dependencies`.

:::warning Helm hooks and concurrency
When using concurrency for Helm deployments that have Helm hooks, be cautious if those hooks depend on resources created by other deployments. You may want such a deployments to be run sequentially after concurrent deployments are completed. Otherwise, appropriate retry logic will be necessary for the affected Helm hook in order to avoid deployment failure.

## Useful Commands

### `devspace list deployments`
This command lists all deployments and their status:
```bash
devspace list deployments
```

### `devspace render`
This command prints all Kubernetes manifests that would be created when running `devspace deploy` or `devspace dev` but without actually deploying them to the cluster:
```bash
devspace render
```
In case of Helm deployments, this command behaves similar to `helm install --dry-run --debug`

:::info Image Building & Tag Replacement
This command will build images (if necessary) and update the tags within manifests and Helm chart values.
