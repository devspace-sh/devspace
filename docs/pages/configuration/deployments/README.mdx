The `deployments` section in `devspace.yaml` defines Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, Kustomizations and Tanka templates that can deployed using the [`create_deployments` function](../functions/README.mdx#create_deployments).


## Workflow
To deploy resources with DevSpace, you need to:
1. Define the `deployments` section of `devspace.yaml`
2. Call the `create_deployments` function inside the `pipelines` section of `devspace.yaml`
3. Execute the respective pipeline


### 1. Define Deployments
To deploy to Kubernetes using DevSpace, we need to define `deployments` in `devspace.yaml`:
```yaml title=devspace.yaml
version: v2beta1
deployments:
  configs:
    kubectl:
      manifests:
      - ./api/deploy/configmap.yaml
      - ./payments/deploy/configmap.yaml
  api:
    helm:
      chart:
        name: component-chart
        repo: https://charts.devspace.sh
      values:
        containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/devspace-example-api
        service:
          ports:
            - port: 8080
  payments:
    helm:
      chart:
        name: ./payments/chart/
      valuesFiles:
      - ./payments/helm-values-dev.yaml
  auth:
    helm:
      chart:
        name: auth-server-chart
        version: 3.2.1
        repo: https://mycompany.tld/helm/
      values:
        ...
  front:
    tanka:
      path: ./front
      environmentPath: environments/default

```
The example above defines 4 deployments:
- `configs` which deploys two ConfigMap objects to Kubernetes from plain manifest files
- `api` which is deployed from the component chart provided by DevSpace
- `payments` which is deployed using a local Helm chart that is located in a folder
- `auth` which is deployed from a chart that has been pushed to a Helm repository
- `front` which is deployed from a Tanka template


### 2. Call `create_deployments` in Pipeline
DevSpace deploys resources to Kubernetes when the [`create_deployments` function](../functions/README.mdx#create_deployments) is called within `pipelines` as shown in this example:

```yaml title=devspace.yaml
version: v2beta1
pipelines:
  # highlight-start
  dev: |-
    create_deployments --all
    start_dev --all
  deploy: |-
    build_images --all
    create_deployments --all
  deploy-api: |-
    create_deployments api
  deploy-ordered: |-
    create_deployments auth
    create_deployments api payments
  # highlight-end

deployments:
  api: ...          # see example above
  payments: ...     # see example above
  auth: ...         # see example above
```


### 3. Run Pipeline
Given the example above, you can now run:
- `devspace deploy` or `devspace dev` to deploy all deployments
- `devspace run-pipeline deploy-api` to deploy only the component chart deployment named `api`
- `devspace run-pipeline deploy-ordered` to  
  1. First deploy `auth` (blocking)
  2. Then deploy `api` and `payments` in parallel
