title: Configure Log Streaming
sidebar_label: logs
---

To control which container logs should be streamed, you can configure the `dev.*.logs` section in the `devspace.yaml`.
```yaml
dev:
  my-dev-1:
    imageSelector: ...
    logs: {}
  my-dev-2:
    imageSelector: ...
    logs: {}
  my-dev-3:
    imageSelector: ...
    logs:
      lastLines: 100
```

DevSpace will continously check what pods match the given selectors and start or end log streaming accordingly.

## Configuration

### `showLast`
The `showLast` option expects an integer which defines how many log lines DevSpace will print for each container before starting to stream the container's logs in real-time.

#### Default Value For `showLast`
```yaml
showLast: 500
```

### `enabled`
The `enabled` option expects a boolean which defines if DevSpace should start log streaming when this dev configuration is started. If logs is defined, `enabled` will default to true.

#### Default Value For `enabled`
```yaml
enabled: true
```
