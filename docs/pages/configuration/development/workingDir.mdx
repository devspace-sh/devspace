`workingDir` allows you to easily change the working directory of the selected development pod.

For example:
```yaml
deployments:
  my-deployment:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
          - image: my-image-prod

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: my-image-prod
    workingDir: /app
    terminal: {}
```

## Configuration

### `workingDir`

If specified, DevSpace will replace the container working directory with the specified directory. Use `devspace reset pods`, `devspace purge` or `stop_dev` within a pipeline to reset the replaced container.
