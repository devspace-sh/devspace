Reverse port-forwarding allows you to forward traffic from within your containers to your local machine. This can be useful when:
- using certain remote debuggers that connect to your IDE instead of the other way around
- developing a service on localhost which should be accessed from other services that run within the cluster, i.e. using the [Telepresence development model](https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/why-telepresence) but with DevSpace to get better performance and cross-platform support

With reverse port-forwarding, you can access `localhost:[PORT]` inside the container and it will redirect to a program that runs on your local dev machine.

When starting the development mode, DevSpace starts reverse port-forwarding as configured in the `dev.*.reversePorts` section of the `devspace.yaml`.
```yaml
deployments:
  app-backend:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: john/devbackend

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: john/devbackend
    ports:
    - port: 8080:80   # Map remote port 80 to local port 8080
    reversePorts:
    - port: 5678:6678 # Map local port 5678 to remote port 6678
```

Every reverse port-forwarding configuration consists of two parts:
- [Pod/Container Selection](#pod-selection)
- [Port Mapping via `port` (and optionally via `remotePort` and `bindAddress`)](#port-mapping-reverseforward)

## Configuration

### `port`
The `port` option defines which localhost `port` should be forwarded to the remote port of the selected container. This means you can access within the container an application that listens on a port on your local computer.

:::note
By default, remote port will take the same value as `port` if no `:` is defined.
:::

:::warning
Using a `port` < 1024 is likely to cause problems as these ports are reserved as system ports.
:::

Examples:
```yaml
port: 8080     # Maps local port 8080 to remote port 8080
port: 8080:80  # Maps local port 8080 to remote port 80
```

### `bindAddress`
The `bindAddress` option expects a valid IP address that the local port should be bound to.

#### Default Value For `bindAddress`
```yaml
bindAddress: "0.0.0.0" # listen on all network interfaces
```
