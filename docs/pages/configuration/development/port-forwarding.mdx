Port-forwarding allows you to access your application on `localhost:[PORT]` by forwarding the network traffic from a localhost port to a specified port of a container.

When starting the development mode, DevSpace starts port-forwarding as configured in the `dev.*.ports` section of the `devspace.yaml`.
```yaml
deployments:
  app-backend:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: john/devbackend

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: john/devbackend
    ports:
    - port: 8080:80 # Map local port 8080 to remote port 80
```

:::warning Unique Local Port
The `port` option must be unique across your entire `ports` section, e.g. you can only use the value `8080` once for the `port` option in your `ports` section.
:::

Every port-forwarding configuration consists of two parts:
- [Pod/Container Selection](#pod-selection)
- [Port Mapping via `port` (and optionally via `bindAddress`)](#port-mapping-forward)

## Configuration

## `port`
The `port` option defines which remote `port` should be forwarded to localhost.

:::note
By default, remote port will take the same value as `port` if no `:` is defined.
:::

:::warning
Using a `port` < 1024 is likely to cause problems as these ports are reserved as system ports.
:::

Examples:
```yaml
port: 8080     # Maps local port 8080 to remote port 8080
port: 8080:80  # Maps local port 8080 to remote port 80
```

### `bindAddress`
The `bindAddress` option expects a valid IP address that the local port should be bound to.

#### Default Value For `bindAddress`
```yaml
bindAddress: "localhost" # listen on all network interfaces
```
