DevSpace offers you the ability to easily persist certain folders in an exchanged pod through a [persistent volume claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims). This might be useful if you have to sync large amounts of files that are needed in multiple containers or the replaced pod might get rescheduled or killed often.

:::info Cleanup of Persistent Volume Claims
If DevSpace creates the persistent volume claim, it will also get cleaned up on a `devspace reset pods` or if config changes in the `replacePods` section are detected.
:::

### `persistPaths`

The `persistPaths` option expects an array of paths that should get persisted on the replaced pod.

#### Example: Persist the folders
```yaml
dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: my-app/dev
    persistPaths:
    - path: /app
      # Optional path on the persistent volume to mount
      # volumePath: my-volume/app
      # Optional name of the container to persist this path
      # containerName: my-container
```

**Explanation:**
- The `imageSelector` would select the pod with image `my-app/dev`.
- DevSpace would create a new persistent volume claim for the pod if the pod was not yet replaced
- DevSpace would replace the pod with a pod which has a volume mount for the path `/app` that references the created persistent volume claim

#### Options

You can configure the following options in a persistent path:

- `path`: the container path that should get persisted
- `volumePath`: optional path on the persistent volume to mount
- `containerName`: optional container name in the replaced pod to persist the path
- `readOnly`: if the path should get mounted read only
- `skipPopulate`: if true, devspace will not try to pre-populate the path
- `initContainer.resources`: resources of the pre-populating init container

### `persistenceOptions`

`persistenceOptions` is an object that defines additional options for `persistPaths`. You can configure the following options:

- `size`: the size of the persistent volume to request. (Defaults to `10Gi`)
- `storageClassName`: the storage class name to use for the persistent volume claim. (Defaults to empty)
- `accessModes`: the access modes to use for the persistent volume claim. (Defaults to `ReadWriteOnce`)
- `readOnly`: if the persistent volume claim should get mounted in read only mode. (Defaults to `false`)
- `name`: the name of the persistent volume claim to use or create. (Defaults to name of the replaced pod)

#### Example: Share a single persistent volume across two pods
```yaml
dev:
  frontend:
    imageSelector: my-image/frontend
    sync:
    - path: .:/app
    persistPaths:
    - path: /app
      volumePath: app
    persistenceOptions:
      name: my-pvc

  backend:
    imageSelector: my-image/backend
    persistPaths:
    - path: /backend
      volumePath: app
    persistenceOptions:
      name: my-pvc
      readOnly: true
```

**Explanation:**
- DevSpace will create a persistent volume claim `my-pvc` if it does not exist
- DevSpace will replace the pods with image `my-image/frontend` and `my-image/backend` with pods that mount the persistent volume claim called `my-pvc`
- DevSpace will sync the local files into the persisted folder `/app` of the replaced pod with image `my-image/frontend`. Since the replaced pods share a common persistent volume claim, also the backend container will get the updated files.
