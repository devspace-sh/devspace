There are two main modes how to develop with DevSpace, by streaming the log output of pods in DevSpace or by opening a terminal to the pod you would like to develop with. If you prefer the latter, you can configure the `dev.*.terminal` option to tell DevSpace to open a terminal to a target container.

In the `dev.*.terminal` section in the `devspace.yaml` you can configure the terminal:
```yaml
deployments:
  app:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: myregistry/myapp

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: myregistry/myapp
    terminal: {}
```

## How does it work?

Under the hood DevSpace will replace the running pod and apply the following changes, before actually starting a terminal to it:
- Remove `readinessProbes`, `startupProbes` & `livenessProbes`
- Change the entrypoint of the container to `sleep 100000`

:::info POD REPLACE
If you don't want DevSpace to replace the pod with a modified version, use `disableReplace: true`
:::

:::info SCREEN
DevSpace will also try to install and use [screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to start the terminal session, as this allows you to reconnect to your existing session after losing connection. You can disable this via the `disableScreen: true` option
:::

## Configuration

### `enabled`

If true or terminal is an empty object, DevSpace will start a terminal to the container.

### `workDir`
If this option is specified DevSpace will open the shell in the specified working directory.

### `command`
The `command` option expects a string as optional configuration for how to open the shell for terminal forwarding.

:::note Command Termination
If `command` is a non-interactive command that terminates, DevSpace will run the command and exits after the command has terminated.
:::

### `disableReplace`

If true, DevSpace will not replace the pod and apply modifications. By default DevSpace will replace the running pod and apply the following changes, before actually starting a terminal to it:
- Remove `readinessProbes`, `startupProbes` & `livenessProbes`
- Change the entrypoint of the container to `sleep 100000`

### `disableScreen`

If true, DevSpace will not use [screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to create a terminal session.
