There are two main modes how to develop with DevSpace, by streaming the log output of pods in DevSpace or by opening a terminal to the pod you would like to develop with. If you prefer the latter, you can configure the `dev.terminal` option to tell DevSpace to open a terminal to a target container. 

In the `dev.terminal` section in the `devspace.yaml` you can configure the terminal:
```yaml {18-23}
images:
  frontend:
    image: myregistry/appfrontend
dependencies:
- name: backend
  source:
    path: backend
deployments:
- name: frontend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: myregistry/appfrontend
        command: ["sleep"]
        args: ["999999999"]
dev:
  terminal: 
    imageSelector: myregistry/appfrontend
    workDir: '/path/to/my/workdir'
    # If you would like to open a different shell or start
    # it with a different command you can also use
    command: ["bash"]
```

:::warning Sleeping Container
You will need to make sure that the container has a terminal equipped and is sleeping so that you can start your application.

## Configuration

### `imageSelector`
<FragmentImageSelector />

#### Example: Setting imageName
```yaml {25-34}
images:
  frontend:
    image: myregistry/appfrontend
  backend:
    image: myregistry/appbackend
deployments:
- name: backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: myregistry/appbackend
- name: frontend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: myregistry/appfrontend
        command: ["sleep"]
        args: ["999999999"]
dev:
  terminal: 
    imageSelector: myregistry/appbackend
```

### `labelSelector`
<FragmentLabelSelector />

#### Example: Setting labelSelector
```yaml {25-34}
dev:
  terminal: 
    labelSelector: 
      app: my-app
    # If the pod has multiple containers make sure to set this
    containerName: container1
```

:::note Execute command locally
If `imageSelector` and `labelSelector` are not defined then the `command` will be executed on your local machine.
:::

### `containerName` 
If you select a pod via `labelSelector` and the pod has multiple containers, you'll need to specify a container name with this option.

### `namespace`
If this option is specified DevSpace will search the pod in this namespace.

### `workDir`
If this option is specified DevSpace will open the shell in the specified working directory.

### `command`
The `command` option expects a string array as optional configuration for how to open the shell for terminal forwarding. If this option is specified, `workDir` will not work anymore.

:::note Command Termination
If `command` is a non-interactive command that terminates, DevSpace will run the command and exits after the command has terminated.
