`devImage` can be used to exchange a container image with a development container, that could include additional tools and helpers to ease development.

For example:
```yaml
deployments:
  my-deployment:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
          - image: my-image-prod

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: my-image-prod
    devImage: my-image-dev
```

## Configuration

### `devImage`

If specified, DevSpace will replace the container image with this development image when starting the dev configuration. Use `devspace reset pods`, `devspace purge` or `stop_dev` within a pipeline to reset the replaced container.

DevSpace will replace the following things in the `devImage` configuration:
- **registry.url/repo/name** that corresponds to a `images.*.image`, will be rewritten to `registry.url/repo/name:generated_tag`
- **${runtime.images.image-key.image}** that corresponds to a `images.*` key, will be rewritten to `registry.url/repo/name`
- **${runtime.images.image-key.tag}** that corresponds to a `images.*` key, will be rewritten to `xApsTn`
