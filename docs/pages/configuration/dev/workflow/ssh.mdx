title: Automatically start an SSH Server
sidebar_label: ssh
---

DevSpace allows you to start an SSH server in the target container, to easily connect to your development environment. This has the following advantages:
- Since IDE's have a great remote SSH integration you can use that directly for your Kubernetes containers
- Use all SSH features and tools such as scp or terminal with your development container

DevSpace will make sure that ssh is properly configured locally and automatically add an entry to your `~/.ssh/config` as well as create an appropriate ssh key pair in `~/.devspace/ssh/id_devspace_rsa` to establish a secure connection with the remote container.
You can then connect to the container with `ssh <dev-config-name>.<devspace-name>.devspace`, where `<dev-config-name>` denotes the name of the dev config and `<devspace-name>` the name of the devspace.yaml file.

For example, to start ssh for an ubuntu container:
```yaml
name: my-devspace-project

deployments:
  my-deployment:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: ubuntu

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: ubuntu
    ssh: {}
```

After starting `devspace dev`, you will be able to connect to the ubuntu container with `ssh my-dev.my-devspace-project.devspace`.

## How does it work?

DevSpace will inject a small helper binary into the running container that contains an SSH server. Then DevSpace will port-forward a random local port to the remote SSH port and configure the local `~/.ssh/config` accordingly.

## Configuration

### `enabled`

If true or ssh is an empty object, DevSpace will start an SSH server in the container.

### `localHostname`

`localHostname` is the local hostname DevSpace should use for the SSH connection. This defaults to `<dev-config-name>.<devspace-name>.devspace`, where `<dev-config-name>` denotes the name of the dev config and `<devspace-name>` the name of the devspace.yaml file.

### `localPort`

`localPort` is the local port that should be forwarded to the remote ssh port. This defaults to a random open port.

### `remoteAddress`

`remoteAddress` is the address to listen to inside the container. Defaults to `:8022`
