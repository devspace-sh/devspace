title: Attaching to a container
sidebar_label: attach

Attach can be used to [attach](https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_attach/) to a process that is already running inside an existing container. Under the hood this is the same as calling `kubectl attach`.

For example
```yaml
deployments:
  my-deployment:
    helm:
      values:
        containers:
        - image: ubuntu

dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: ubuntu
    attach: {}
```

## How does it work?

Under the hood DevSpace will replace the running pod and apply the following changes, before actually attaching to it:
- Remove `readinessProbes`, `startupProbes` & `livenessProbes`
- Add `stdin: true` and `tty: true` to the container spec

:::info
If you don't want DevSpace to replace the pod with a modified version, use `disableReplace: true`
:::

## Configuration

### `enabled`

If true or attach is an empty object, DevSpace will attach to the container.

### `disableReplace`

If true, DevSpace will not replace the pod.

### `disableTTY`

If true, DevSpace will not set `tty: true` during replacing the pod.
