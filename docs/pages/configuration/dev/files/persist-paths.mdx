DevSpace offers you the ability to easily persist certain folders in an exchanged pod through a [persistent volume claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims). This might be useful if you have to sync large amounts of files that are needed in multiple containers or the replaced pod might get rescheduled or killed often.

:::info Cleanup of Persistent Volume Claims
If DevSpace creates the persistent volume claim, it will also get cleaned up on a `devspace reset pods` or if config changes in the `replacePods` section are detected.
:::

### `persistPaths`

The `persistPaths` option expects an array of paths that should get persisted on the replaced pod.

#### Example: Persist the folders
```yaml
dev:
  my-dev:
    imageSelector: my-app/dev
    persistPaths:
    - path: /app
      # Optional path on the persistent volume to mount
      # volumePath: my-volume/app
      # Optional name of the container to persist this path
      # containerName: my-container
```

**Explanation:**
- The `imageSelector` would select the pod with image `my-app/dev`.
- DevSpace would create a new persistent volume claim for the pod if the pod was not yet replaced
- DevSpace would replace the pod with a pod which has a volume mount for the path `/app` that references the created persistent volume claim

#### Options

You can configure the following options in a persistent path:

- `path`: the container path that should get persisted
- `volumePath`: optional path on the persistent volume to mount
- `containerName`: optional container name in the replaced pod to persist the path
- `readOnly`: if the path should get mounted read only
- `skipPopulate`: if true, devspace will not try to pre-populate the path
- `initContainer.resources`: resources of the pre-populating init container
