title: "Profiles: Activation"
sidebar_label: activation

The `activation` option is optional and allows you to activate a profile using regular expression matching of either Devspace or environment variables. An activation is configured with the profile it activates in `devspace.yaml`.


#### Example: Defining a Profile Activation using `vars`
```yaml {1-3,7-8}
vars:
  ENV:
    default: development
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - vars:
      ENV: production
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/prodbackend
```
The `production` profile would be activated when the Devspace variable `ENV` has value `production`.  In this example, it has a default value of `development`, so it is not activated unless you override the value using `--var ENV=production`

#### Example: Defining a Profile Activation using Environment Variables
```yaml {3-5}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      ENV: "production"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/prodbackend
```
The `production` profile would be activated when the environment variable `ENV` has value `production`:

#### Example: Regular Expression Activation
```yaml {3-5}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      ENV: "prod-\d+"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/prodbackend
```
The profile `production` would be activated when the environment variable `ENV` matches the regular expression `prod-\d+`. This can be useful for matching environment variables that have dynamic values. Regular expressions will have start of string (`^`) and end of string (`$`) anchors added automatically to avoid unexpected substring matching. 

#### Example: Matching All
When multiple `env` or `vars` name/expression pairs are specified in the same activation, all expressions must match to activate the profile. For example, the `production` profile is activated when the environment variable `CI` is `true` and the Devspace variable `ENV` is `development`:
```yaml {3-7}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      CI: "true"
    vars:
      ENV: "development"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/devbackend
```

:::note Combining `env` and `vars`
While possible to activate profiles using environment variables and Devspace variables, `vars` can also be populated through environment variables. In the above example, we could have also defined `CI` as a Devspace variable with `source: env` and only used `vars` in the activation.
:::

#### Example: Matching Any
When `env` or `vars` are used in multiple activations, the profile is activated when any expression matches. In this example, the `production` profile is activated when either match their expressions:
```yaml {3-7}
profiles:
- name: production
  activation:
  - env:
      CI: "true"
  - vars:
      ENV: "development"
  patches:
  - op: replace
    path: images.backend.image
    value: john/devbackend
```

### Dependency Activations
When `dependencies` are referenced from a `devspace.yaml`, the dependency's profile activations will also be evaluated. In this example, any profile activations in `./component-1/devspace.yaml` or `./component-2/devspace.yaml` would be evaluated.

```yaml
dependencies:
  component-1:
    path: ./component-1
  component-2:
    path: ./component-2
```

#### Example: Disable Activations by Dependency
The `disableProfileActivation` option can be used to disable profile activations for specific dependencies. In the following example, the activations for `./component-1/devspace.yaml` would be ignored, while the activations in `./component-2/devspace.yaml` would be evaluated:
```yaml {5}
dependencies:
  component-1:
    path: ./component-1
    disableProfileActivation: true
  component-2:
    path: ./component-2
```

### Disable Activations Globally
The `--disable-profile-activation` flag can be used to disable all profile activations, including those specifed within each dependency's `devspace.yaml`.
