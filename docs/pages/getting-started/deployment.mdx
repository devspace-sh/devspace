Once you are done with developing your application or you just want to test if it works even outside of development mode with your actual container image, you can start a clean deployment.

    <source src={require('@site/static/img/devspace-deploy.mp4').default} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

## Kube-Context & Namespace
For this clean deployment, you may want to switch to a different namespace or even to a different cluster to test your application in a cloud-powered cluster, for example.

<KubeContextFragment/>


## Deploy Project
Run the local deployment pipeline using this command:
```bash
devspace deploy -p production
```

Running `devspace deploy -p production` will do the following:

1. **Build the Dockerfile(s)** specified in the [`images` section of the `devspace.yaml`](../configuration/images/basics.mdx)
2. **Tag** the resulting image(s) with an auto-generated tag according to a [customizable tag schema](../configuration/images/basics.mdx)
3. **Push** the resulting Docker images to the specified registries
4. **Create image pull secrets** in your Kubernetes namespace (optional, enabled by default)
5. **Deploy** everything that is defined within the [`deployments` section in the `devspace.yaml`](../configuration/deployments/basics.mdx)

:::note Image Building Only
If you only want to build, tag and push all images but not deploy anything, run:
```bash
devspace build
```

## Understand Profiles
As shown earlier, DevSpace is by default configured to skip image building, for example. However, to fully test your containerized application you may want to create a fresh image and push this image to a registry.

Profiles allow you to apply modifications to your `devspace.yaml` configuration for certain use cases or for different deployment targets (e.g. dev vs testing vs production).

By default, `devspace init` adds a small example profile called `production` which only removes the `disabled: true` statement from our `images` section which in turn enables image building:
```yaml
profiles:
- name: production
  patches:
  - op: remove
    path: images.app.build.disabled
```

You can print the config after a profile has been applied to see what the profile actually changes:
```bash
devspace print -p production
```

The flag `-p / --profile` is global, so we can also use them for other commands and define profiles that apply to different workflows for commands such as `devspace dev`:
```bash
devspace dev -p start-debugger
```
