title: What is DevSpace?
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

DevSpace is a client-only, open-source developer tool for Kubernetes:
- **Build, test and debug applications directly inside Kubernetes**
- **Develop with hot reloading**: updates your running containers without rebuilding images or restarting containers
- **Unify deployment workflows** within your team and across dev, staging and production
- **Automate repetitive tasks** for image building and deployment

## How does it work?
DevSpace runs as a single binary CLI tool directly on your computer and ideally, you use it straight from the terminal within your IDE. DevSpace does not require a server-side component as it communicates directly to your Kubernetes cluster using your kube-context, just like kubectl.

## Why DevSpace?
Building modern, distributed and highly scalable microservices with Kubernetes is hard - and it is even harder for large teams of developers. DevSpace is the next-generation tool for fast cloud-native software development.


### Declarative Workflows
DevSpace allows you to store all your workflows in one declarative config file: `devspace.yaml`
- **Codify workflow knowledge** about building images, deploying your project and its dependencies etc.
- **Version your workflows together with your code** (i.e. you can get any old version up and running with just a single command) 
- **Share your workflows** with your team mates


### Made For Teams
DevSpace helps your team to standardize deployment and development workflows without requiring everyone on your team to become a Kubernetes expert.
- The DevOps and Kubernetes expert on your team can configure DevSpace using `devspace.yaml` and simply commits it via git
- If other developers on your team check out the project, they only need to run `devspace deploy` to deploy the project (including image building and deployment of other related project etc.) and they have a running instance of the project
- The configuration of DevSpace is highly dynamic, so you can configure everything using [config variables](configuration/variables/basics.mdx) that make it much easier to have one base configuration but still allow differences among developers (e.g. different sub-domains for testing)


### Hot Reloading
Instead of rebuilding images and redeploying containers, DevSpace allows you to **hot reload running containers while you are coding**:
- Simply edit your files with your IDE and see how your application reloads within the running container.
- The **high performance, bi-directional file synchronization** detects code changes immediately and synchronizes files immediately between your local dev environment and the containers running in Kubernetes
- Stream logs, connect debuggers or open a container terminal directly from your IDE with just a single command.


### Automation
Deploying and debugging services with Kubernetes requires a lot of knowledge and forces you to repeatedly run commands like `kubectl get pod` and copy pod ids back and forth. Stop wasting time and let DevSpace automate the tedious parts of working with Kubernetes:
- DevSpace lets you build multiple images in parallel, tag them automatically and deploy your entire application (including its dependencies) with just a single command
- Let DevSpace automatically start port-fowarding and log streaming, so you don't have to constantly copy and paste pod ids or run 10 commands to get everything started.


### Compatibility
DevSpace is battle tested with many Kubernetes distributions including:
- **Local Kubernetes clusters** like minikube, k3s, MikroK8s, kind
- **Managed Kubernetes clusters** in GKE (Google), EKS (AWS), AKS (Azure), DOKS (Digital Ocean)
- **Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** (e.g. created with Rancher)
