## Initialize Your Project
Run this command in your project directory to create a `devspace.yaml` config file for your project:
```bash
devspace init
```

```bash

? How do you want to deploy this project?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> helm: Use Component Helm Chart [QUICK START] (https://devspace.sh/component-chart/docs)
  helm: Use my own Helm chart (e.g. local via ./chart/ or any remote chart)
  kubectl: Use existing Kubernetes manifests (e.g. ./kube/deployment.yaml)
  kustomize: Use an existing Kustomization (e.g. ./kube/kustomization/)
```

DevSpace will ask you a couple of questions about this project and then generate a `devspace.yaml` for you to start with. If you are using the quickstart projects, choose `Component Helm Chart` for the first question.

After running `devspace init`, you will see a `devspace.yaml` file in your project which should look like this:
```yaml
version: v1beta10

# `images` specifies all images that may need to be built for this project
images:
  app: # This image is called `app` and this name `app` is referenced multiple times in the config below
    image: registry.tld/username/image
    dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    build:
      disabled: true

# `deployments` tells DevSpace how to deploy this project
deployments:
- name: quickstart-kubectl
  # This deployment uses `kubectl` but you can also define `helm` deployments
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - kube/deployment.yaml
# OR:
- name: quickstart-helm                   # Name of this deployment
  helm:                                   # Deploy using Helm
    componentChart: true                  # Use the Component Helm Chart
    values:                               # Override Values for chart (can also be set using valuesFiles option)
      containers:                         # Defines an array of containers that run in the same pods started by this component
      - image: image(app):tag(app)        # Image of this container
      service:                            # Expose this component with a Kubernetes service
        ports:                            # Array of container ports to expose through the service
        - port: 3000                      # Exposes container port 3000 on service port 3000
