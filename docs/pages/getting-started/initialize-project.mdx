## Choose a Project
You can either deploy one of your own projects or alternatively, checkout one of our demo applications using git:

<ChooseProjectFragment/>


<br/>

## Initialize Your Project
Run this command in your project directory to create a `devspace.yaml` config file for your project:
```bash
devspace init
```

```

info Detecting programming language...
```

DevSpace's initialization wizard will walk you through the setup of the project
```
? Select the programming language of this project  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  c# (dotnet)
> go
  java-gradle
  java-maven
  javascript
  php
  python
```
Choose the language of your quickstart project. This will determine the correct [devImage](/configuration/dev/modifications/dev-image).

```
? How do you want to deploy this project?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> helm
  kubectl
  kustomize
```
Now, you can pick your preferred way to deploy the project. For now, choose [`helm`](/configuration/deployments/helm/), you can always mix and match later.

```
? Is this a DevSpace Quickstart project?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Yes
  No
```
DevSpace can detect when you're using a quickstart project.

```
? Do you want to develop this project with DevSpace or just deploy it?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> I want to develop this project and my current working dir contains the source code
  I just want to deploy this project
```
When initializing DevSpace, you can ask it to monitor the source code for changes, or to only set up what's needed for deploying your application.  
Since we want to see how DevSpace handles the entire development cycle, choose the first option here.

```
? How should DevSpace build the container image for this project?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Use this existing Dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
  Use a different Dockerfile (e.g. ./backend/Dockerfile)
  Use alternative build tool (e.g. jib, bazel)
  Skip / I don't know
```
DevSpace expects to receive instructions, how to containerize the source code. For the quickstart projects, a Dockerfile is provided in the root folder.

```
? If you were to push any images, which container registry would you want to push to?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Skip Registry
  Use hub.docker.com
  Use GitHub image registry
  Use other registry
```
For local development and quick feedback cycles, we recommend to skip pushing images to any registry.

```
done Project successfully initialized
info Configuration saved in devspace.yaml - you can make adjustments as needed

You can now run:
1. devspace use namespace - to pick which Kubernetes namespace to work in
2. devspace dev - to start developing your project in Kubernetes

Run `devspace -h` or `devspace [command] -h` to see a list of available commands and flags
```
Congratulations! You have succesfully initialized your first DevSpace project! ðŸŽ‰

After running `devspace init`, you will see 3 changes in your project:
1. New file `devspace.yaml` (tells DevSpace how this project should be build, deployed, and developed)
2. New file `devspace_start.sh` (is used to show information to the user when the terminal for the dev container opens)
3. Added `.devspace/` folder to `.gitignore` (the `.devspace/` folder is used by DevSpace to store some information locally when you are working with this project, e.g. caching to speed up things)

The `devspace.yaml` should look similar to this one:
```yaml title=devspace.yaml
version: v2beta1
