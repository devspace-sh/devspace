## Choose a Project
You can either deploy one of your own projects or alternatively, checkout one of our demo applications using git:

<ChooseProjectFragment/>

## Initialize Your Project
Run this command in your project directory to create a `devspace.yaml` config file for your project:
```bash
devspace init
```

```

info Detecting programming language...

DevSpace will ask you a couple of questions about this project, e.g. which programming language the application is written in, how to deploy the project, etc.

After running `devspace init`, you will see 3 changes in your project:
1. New file `devspace.yaml` (tells DevSpace how this project should be build, deployed, and developed)
2. New file `devspace_start.yaml` (is used to show information to the user when the terminal for the dev container opens)
3. Added `.devspace/` folder to `.gitignore` (the `.devspace/` folder is used by DevSpace to store some information locally when you are working with this project, e.g. caching to speed up things)

The `devspace.yaml` should look similar to this one:
```yaml title=devspace.yaml
version: v2beta1
name: devspace-quickstart-golang
