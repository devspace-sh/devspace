DevSpace provides several commands that help you clean up things locally and in your Kubernetes cluster.


## Reset Dev Container
The idea behind the dev container in DevSpace is that DevSpace deploys your application using your prod/stable Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts, etc. and then, DevSpace selects one of your containers, changes this container (e.g. swap out the prod/stable image with a prebuilt dev image), and then connects to this dev container using file sync, port forwarding, terminal session, etc.

To reverse the changes that DevSpace makes when the `start_dev` command is called within a pipeline, you can run:
```bash
devspace reset pods
```


## Purge Project From Cluster
To tell DevSpace to remove the deployments from your cluster again, run:
```bash
devspace purge
```


## Reset Variables
If you are using any variables in DevSpace and you provided values for these variables, you can reset them using:
```bash
devspace reset vars
```


## Cleanup Images
If you are building images using DevSpace (e.g. via `devspace build`) and your local Docker daemon now has 100s of images with different tags, you can clean them up via:
```bash
devspace cleanup images
```


## Cleanup Local Registry
If you are building images using DevSpace (e.g. via `devspace build`) and a local registry was used for pushing images to your cluster, the local registry can be cleaned up via:
```bash
devspace cleanup local-registry
```
